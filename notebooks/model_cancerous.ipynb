    "a. CNN():\n",
    "This function creates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. It consists of a series of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers, along with activation functions, dropout, and normalization layers.\n",

    "b. SVM():\n",
    "This function creates a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for image classification. It uses a kernel function to map the images into a high-dimensional feature space, where it finds the optimal hyperplane that separates the cancerous and non-cancerous cells or the different cell types.\n",
